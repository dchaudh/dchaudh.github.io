# OSFI's B-15 Guideline Explained

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) published its climate risk management guideline earlier this month. The guideline has been in the making since last June and marks the first guideline to be issued by a major financial institutions' regulator in North America. In this article, we will explain the why, what, who, when, where, and how of this publication.

It is important to go over the fundamentals of climate risk for us to fully understand why OSFI has issued this guideline. Broadly speaking, climate risk consists of two major categories: physical risk and transition risk.

Physical risk is the financial risk arising from extreme climate-related events such as floods, cyclones, wildfires, etc. (acute risk) and from the gradual change in the Earth's climate such as increased sea levels, etc. (chronic risk). On the other hand, transition risk is the financial risk arising due to the world shifting towards a low-carbon economy, such as decreased market value of fossil fuel-related investments, etc.

Climate risk is a cross-cutting risk; that is, not a risk in its own right but one that manifests through existing risk channels such as credit, market, insurance, operational, and liquidity risks, etc. As climate-related risks are likely to intensify over time, there is an increased threat to the viability of financial institutions' (FIs) business models, especially under severe cases. Through this guideline, OSFI aims to support FIs in climate risk management and subsequently increase FIs' resilience to climate risk.
