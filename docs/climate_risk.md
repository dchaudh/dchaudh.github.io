# OSFI's B-15 Guideline Explained

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) published its climate risk management guideline earlier this
month. The guideline has been in the making since last June and marks the first guideline to be issued by a major financial
institutions' regulator in North America. In this article, we will explain the 5Ws and 1H of this publication.

## Why has OSFI issued this guideline?
It is important to go over the fundamentals of climate risk for us to fully understand why OSFI has issued this guideline. Broadly speaking, climate risk consists of two major categories: physical risk and transition risk.

Physical risk is the financial risk arising from extreme climate-related events such as floods, cyclones, wildfires, etc. (acute risk) and from the gradual change in the Earth's climate such as increased sea levels, etc. (chronic risk). On the other hand, transition risk is the financial risk arising due to the world shifting towards a low-carbon economy, such as decreased market value of fossil fuel-related investments, etc.

Climate risk is a cross-cutting risk; that is, not a risk in its own right but one that manifests through existing risk channels such as credit, market, insurance, operational, and liquidity risks, etc. As climate-related risks are likely to intensify over time, there is an increased threat to the viability of financial institutions' (FIs) business models, especially under severe, yet plausible, scenarios. Through this guideline, OSFI aims to support FIs in climate risk management and subsequently increase FIs' resilience to climate risk.

## What does the guideline say?

The guideline sets out OSFI's expectations for climate risk management. This guideline is to be used in conjunction with other OSFI guidance, including but not limited to the Corporate Governance Guideline, Guideline E-18: Stress Testing, Guideline E-19: Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), and Guideline E-19: Internal Capital Adequacy Process (ICAAP), which address the elements of climate risk management. There are two main categories of OSFI's expectations: Climate Risk Management and Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.

### Climate Risk Management

#### Governance
FIs are expected to establish the appropriate governance structure, involving the board of directors and senior management, to manage climate risk. Additionally, FIs are expected to understand and incorporate the impact of climate risk on their business model and strategic plans.
#### Risk Management
FIs are expected to identify, assess, and manage climate risk in tandem with their risk appetite framework. As climate risk is a cross-cutting risk, FIs are expected to integrate climate risk into their Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. Furthermore, FIs should implement appropriate tools and models to measure the current and future impact of climate risk over various time horizons. The guideline also recognizes that FIs might have limited data available pertaining to climate risk. In instances where such data gaps exist, FIs should use alternative data sources/proxies. Whenever FIs use external sources for help, be it for models or data, they should adequately understand their behind-the-scenes mechanics. For FIs to assess the effectiveness and progress of their climate risk management, they should set and monitor metrics and targets. FIs should also have reporting systems to support strategic planning and risk management.
#### Climate Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing
In addition to governance and risk management expectations, FIs are expected to use climate scenario analysis and stress testing to assess the impact of climate risk on their risk profile, business strategy, and business model. FIs should not take climate scenario analysis lightly as OSFI will require FIs to complete standardized climate scenario exercises and report results back to them on a periodic basis.

#### Capital and Liquidity Adequacy
Last but not least, FIs should incorporate climate risk into their ICAAP or ORSA process to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity buffers.

### Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
OSFI reinforces its climate risk management expectations through climate-related financial disclosure expectations, which are highly aligned with the recommendations of the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). As with TCFD, OSFI's disclosure expectations are structured around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how companies operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. These disclosures help OSFI meet its mandate of protecting depositors, creditors, and policyholders and contributing to public confidence in the Canadian financial system.

To help achieve high-quality disclosures that enable users, who may be investors, analysts, and the public at large, to understand the impact of climate change on FIs, FIs should follow these six principles:

1. The FRFI should disclose relevant information.
2. The FRFI should disclose specific and comprehensive information.
3. The FRFI should disclose clear, balanced, and understandable information.
4. The FRFI should disclose reliable and verifiable information.
5. The FRFI should disclose information appropriate for its size, nature, and complexity.
6. The FRFI should disclose information consistently over time.
