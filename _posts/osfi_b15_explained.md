# OSFI's B-15 Guideline Explained

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) published its climate risk management guideline earlier this
month. The guideline has been in the making since last June and marks the first guideline to be issued by a major financial
institutions' regulator in North America. In this article, we will explain the 5Ws and 1H of this publication.

## Why has OSFI issued this guideline?
It is important to go over the fundamentals of climate risk for us to fully understand why OSFI has issued this guideline. Broadly speaking, climate risk consists of two major categories: physical risk and transition risk.

Physical risk is the financial risk arising from extreme climate-related events such as floods, cyclones, wildfires, etc. (acute risk) and from the gradual change in the Earth's climate such as increased sea levels, etc. (chronic risk). On the other hand, transition risk is the financial risk arising due to the world shifting towards a low-carbon economy, such as decreased market value of fossil fuel-related investments, etc.

Climate risk is a cross-cutting risk; that is, not a risk in its own right but one that manifests through existing risk channels such as credit, market, insurance, operational, and liquidity risks, etc. As climate-related risks are likely to intensify over time, there is an increased threat to the viability of financial institutions' (FIs) business models, especially under severe, yet plausible, scenarios. Through this guideline, OSFI aims to support FIs in climate risk management and subsequently increase FIs' resilience to climate risk.

## What does the guideline say?

The guideline sets out OSFI's expectations for climate risk management. This guideline is to be used in conjunction with other OSFI guidance, including but not limited to the Corporate Governance Guideline, Guideline E-18: Stress Testing, Guideline E-19: Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), and Guideline E-19: Internal Capital Adequacy Process (ICAAP), which address the elements of climate risk management. There are two main categories of OSFI's expectations: Climate Risk Management and Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.

### Governance
FIs are expected to establish the appropriate governance structure, involving the board of directors and senior management, to manage climate risk. Additionally, FIs are expected to understand and incorporate the impact of climate risk on their business model and strategic plans.
### Risk Management
FIs are expected to identify, assess, and manage climate risk in tandem with their risk appetite framework. As climate risk is a cross-cutting risk, FIs are expected to integrate climate risk into their Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. Furthermore, FIs should implement appropriate tools and models to measure the current and future impact of climate risk over various time horizons. The guideline also recognizes that FIs might have limited data available pertaining to climate risk. In instances where such data gaps exist, FIs should use alternative data sources/proxies. Whenever FIs use external sources for help, be it for models or data, they should adequately understand their behind-the-scenes mechanics. For FIs to assess the effectiveness and progress of their climate risk management, they should set and monitor metrics and targets. FIs should also have reporting systems to support strategic planning and risk management.
### Climate Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing
In addition to governance and risk management expectations, FIs are expected to use climate scenario analysis and stress testing to assess the impact of climate risk on their risk profile, business strategy, and business model. FIs should not take climate scenario analysis lightly as OSFI will require FIs to complete standardized climate scenario exercises and report results back to them on a periodic basis.

### Capital and Liquidity Adequacy
Last but not least, FIs should incorporate climate risk into their ICAAP or ORSA process to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity buffers.

<details><summary>Climate-Related Financial Disclosures</summary>

OSFI reinforces its climate risk management expectations through climate-related financial disclosure expectations, which are highly aligned with the recommendations of the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). As with TCFD, OSFI's disclosure expectations are structured around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how companies operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. These disclosures help OSFI meet its mandate of protecting depositors, creditors, and policyholders and contributing to public confidence in the Canadian financial system.

To help achieve high-quality disclosures that enable users, who may be investors, analysts, and the public at large, to understand the impact of climate change on FIs, FIs should follow these six principles:

1. Disclose relevant information.
2. Disclose specific and comprehensive information.
3. Disclose clear, balanced, and understandable information.
4. Disclose reliable and verifiable information.
5. Disclose information appropriate for its size, nature, and complexity.
6. Disclose information consistently over time. 

The disclosures should be published, at a minimum, annually. FIs may exercise discretion regarding the location for these disclosures. Possible locations include, but are not limited to, a report to shareholders or a stand-alone report (e.g., Climate Risk Report, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report) as long as these are made available to the public. Additionally, FIs have the flexibility to present this information in a way that best suits them.

## Who does this guideline apply to?

The guideline applies to all federally regulated financial institutions, i.e., banks, trust and loan companies, life insurance companies, property and casualty (P&C) companies, except foreign bank branches.

## When will this guideline become effective?

The expectations outlined in the guideline will become effective in a phased approach. The minimum mandatory climate-related financial disclosures will become effective from the fiscal period ending on or after October 1, 2024, for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) and Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs). For other in-scope FIs, the guideline will become effective from the fiscal year ending on or after October 1, 2025.

FIs are expected to publish financial disclosures no later than 180 days after the fiscal year-end.

## How can FIs get started with this guideline?

Overall, financial institutions need to integrate climate risk management into their core business practices to effectively manage climate risks and contribute to a sustainable future. FIs can identify, assess, and manage climate risks by using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Here are some key approaches:

1. Data analytics: FIs need to gather and analyze historical climate data, economic data, and exposure data to identify potential risk hotspots. If FIs do not have such data, they can use third-party vendor products.
2. Risk modeling: FIs need to create new risk models (e.g., estimate changes in loan-to-value ratio, calculate climate-risk adjusted probability of defaults) or at a minimum fine-tune their existing risk models (since the time horizon for climate risk is much larger than the traditional time horizon of one to three years) to assess the potential financial impact of climate change on their business. These models need to take into account a range of factors, including historical climate data, future climate projections, and exposure data, to estimate potential losses.
3. Scenario analysis and stress testing: Financial institutions need to perform scenario analysis to assess the potential impact of different climate scenarios on their business. They should also include stress scenarios to assess the resilience of their business. Other than the standardized scenarios that would be provided by OSFI, FIs can use climate scenarios provided by organizations such as Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).
4. Expert judgment: Financial institutions can also use qualitative methods, such as the opinions of industry experts, to supplement their quantitative analysis and assess the potential impact of climate change on their business.

Using these approaches, once FIs have established a baseline for their current performance in climate risk management, they should set and monitor measurable metrics and targets (e.g., carbon footprint, portfolio alignment with climate goals such as the Paris Agreement or national targets for emissions reduction, etc.) to drive and track progress in managing climate risks.
